## 🔍 Business Insights Delivered

1. 🏆 **Top Revenue Categories** –  Product Category 1 generates the highest revenue ($22.7M), followed by Categories 8 and 5. However, Categories 20 and 19 contribute less than $12k. These low-performing categories may warrant further investigation to assess their relevance, marketing investment, or potential phase-out. 

2. ❤️ **Marital Status & Spending** – Across all city categories, unmarried customers consistently purchase more products than married ones. This suggests that marketing efforts focused on single individuals—especially in City Category B—could yield higher returns.

3. 📊 **Age-Based Spending** – Customers aged 26–35 spend the most in total ($51.31M), making them the most profitable segment. However, the 51–55 age group has the highest average spent per product, suggesting a smaller but high-value audience.
